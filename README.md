# Snippety

This is my testing ground to try and integrate Django and some front-end framework (probably Next.js but Flask kinda counts).

## Install

```bash
# Manually
pip install Django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt "psycopg[binary,pool]"

# Through requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
